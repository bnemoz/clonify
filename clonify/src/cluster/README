Compiling
=========

Test platform: Linux, with g++ 4.8.2.

Running make will create an executable named "cluster".


Usage
=====

usage: ./cluster [options...] input.json output.txt

Options:
  --min-center-size=INTEGER:  set the minimum center size to INTEGER.
                              Controls the speed-vs-accuracy tradeoff.
                              Reasonable values range from 10 to N/10000.
                              (e.g. 10 to 100 when processing 1M antibodies)
                              Lower values are generally more accurate.
                              Higher values are generally faster, but values
                              that are too high run extremely slowly.
  --min-center-size=disabled: disable megaclustering.
                              Warning: very slow and memory hungry!
                              Don't use with large datasets.
